  	<p> Originally designed by renowned American architects, the buildings were already in decay when Payne came upon them, capturing their eerie atmosphere in his photographs. In his work, Payne – whose work we’ve featured previously – specializes in documentary photography. Speaking of the idea behind this project, he says: “From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth, more than 250 institutions for the insane were built throughout the United States; by 1948 they housed over half a million patients. But over the next thirty years, with the introduction of psychotropic drugs and policy shifts toward community-based care, patient populations declined dramatically, leaving many of these massive buildings neglected and abandoned.”
